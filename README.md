## Working Title Game
 With a title like that how can you not love it! This game allows the user to fly through the skys avoiding. I built the game starting with the character movement, eventually adding in enemies and then the abilty to shoot at the enemies.
 
 ## Process
 
This app was made from my lifelong interest in videogames. I wanted to get a game up and running in a quick period and from my research found PyGame as the result.

 ### Made with Python and PyGame
